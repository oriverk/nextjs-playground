# i18n routing with Next.js ver 9.x.x

## special thanks to 

This is a really simple project to try nextjs i18n routing with ssg. And this refers to a dev.to post named [i18n with Next.js and full SSG support](https://dev.to/biscuitech/i18n-with-next-js-and-full-ssg-support-2aih). This post was written when Next.js was ver.9.
